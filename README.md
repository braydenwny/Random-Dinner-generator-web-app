# Random-Dinner-generator-web-app
This is a Random Dinner generator web application made with HTML, CSS, Flask, Pandas and JSON
I am trying to figure out how to deploy it onto the web, but if you want to use locally you must have flask and pandas installed, as well as python
  (pip install Flask and pip install Pandas)
